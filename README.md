# Flight Logbook

This personal java project is a Flight Logbook application built with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, MySQL, and Thymeleaf, enabling me to add, read, update, and delete flight records from a database. It includes form data validation using Spring Boot's validation framework for user input handling.
